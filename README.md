# Citadel

**An open-source operating layer for Claude Code and OpenAI Codex.**

Citadel routes requests, preserves repository state between sessions,
coordinates parallel work, applies repository safeguards, and records evidence
and handoffs around the coding agent you already use.

## Install

**Requires:** Claude Code or OpenAI Codex, Node.js 22+, and a git repository.

Citadel is installed through the plugin marketplace already built into your
coding agent. The commands below pin the complete `v1.3.7` release; if that tag
is not present on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel/releases),
do not substitute floating `main`.

**Verified release · Project-local activation · Removable · No npm package**

### OpenAI Codex

Run these commands from the repository you want Citadel to manage:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add SethGammon/Citadel --ref v1.3.7
codex plugin add citadel@citadel-local
```

Start a new Codex task, review Citadel through `/hooks`, then give it a real
request such as `/do review README.md`.

### Claude Code

Run these commands from the repository you want Citadel to manage:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add SethGammon/Citadel@v1.3.7 --scope local
claude plugin install citadel@citadel-local --scope local
```

Run `/reload-plugins` if Claude Code is already open, then give Citadel a real
request such as `/do review README.md`.

### Prefer to have your agent install it?

Paste this into Claude Code or Codex. It explains both what Citadel is and the
boundary the installer must preserve:

```text
Citadel is an open-source operating layer for Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. It
adds one /do entry point, repository-local state that survives sessions,
guarded multi-step workflows, and reviewable evidence with explicit Needs You
and Resume boundaries.

Install Citadel v1.3.7 from https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel using this
runtime's native plugin marketplace, then enable it for this repository. Use
project-local defaults and preserve removal evidence for every change. Do not clone main or change shared
configuration, sandbox settings, permissions, or user-wide settings without
asking me.

Only interrupt me for a platform-required trust or reload action, or for a real
configuration conflict. Verify the result, then tell me the single next action.
```

The platform owns plugin acquisition and executable-code trust. Citadel owns
bounded project state and recovery. Plans, digests, receipts, and doctor checks
remain available as evidence, but are not user chores on the normal path.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual, offline, and high-assurance installation</strong></summary>

<br>

1. Open the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel/releases)
   page and choose an explicit `vX.Y.Z` release.
2. Download `citadel-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`, its `.manifest.json`, and its `.sha256`
   sidecar into one directory.
3. Compare the archive's SHA-256 with both published values before extraction.
   A missing asset or mismatch is a blocked install.
4. Extract the archive, then use its single `citadel-X.Y.Z/` directory as the
   immutable source for the governed adoption plan.

From the target repository, with `CITADEL_ROOT` pointing at that extracted
directory, the compact Linux/macOS form is below. Windows users should use the
quoted `$env:CITADEL_ROOT` PowerShell path in [Installation](INSTALL.md).

```bash
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" plan "$CITADEL_ROOT" \
  --target . --project-runtime codex \
  --out ../citadel-adoption.plan.json --json

node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" apply ../citadel-adoption.plan.json \
  --confirm <plan-token> --json

node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" doctor --target . --json
```

Use `--project-runtime claude` for Claude Code or `both` only when both runtime
projections are intentional. Runtime-specific enable steps are in
[Installation](INSTALL.md).

Keep every saved plan outside the target repository. Writing the plan inside
the target changes the preflight snapshot and causes apply to reject
`TARGET_DRIFT`.

</details>

For contributor testing only, a source checkout may use
`git clone --branch main https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel.git`. That path
is development-only: it has no release trio or immutable version boundary and
must not be presented as a stable install.

See [Installation](INSTALL.md) for platform-specific checksum commands,
runtime enable steps, rollback, and uninstall. See [Releases](docs/RELEASES.md)
for the artifact and provenance contract.

## Start using it

<img src="assets/terminal-demo.svg" width="100%" alt="An illustrative live Citadel runtime session moving from request through run and evidence to resume" />

Start with `/do` and describe the outcome:

```text
/do review README.md
/do generate tests for the changed files
/do preview build a caching layer
/do next
```

Exact commands resolve only when the normalized whole request matches. The
project commands `/do test`, `/do build`, and `/do typecheck` additionally
require the corresponding non-empty target `package.json` script. Larger
requests collect generated candidates and then require runtime semantic
classification.

`/do preview` shares only the exact-command and built-in candidate preflight.
It does not inspect active state, discover project-local skills, or run the
runtime LLM classifier. Every natural-language preview is non-executable:
`selected` and `command` are null, `canRunNow` is false, and the boundary is
`semantic-classification-required`.

If you already know the destination, a validated override is available without
bypassing activation or safety boundaries:

```text
/do --route /test-gen -- generate tests for the changed files
```

The operating loop uses five public states:

| State | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Request** | You describe the outcome through `/do` or a known skill. |
| **Run** | The selected workflow acts within runtime, repository, and approval boundaries. |
| **Evidence** | Checks and artifacts report `passed`, `failed`, `blocked`, or `unknown`. |
| **Needs You** | Citadel stops with the exact approval, conflict, or missing evidence required. |
| **Resume** | Repo-local state names the next useful action for a fresh session. |

## When Citadel is useful

Citadel is most useful when coding-agent work extends beyond one prompt:

| You are dealing with... | Citadel adds... |
|---|---|
| Repeated setup and lost context | Repo-local decisions, discoveries, and handoffs |
| Unclear workflow choice | One natural-language entry point through `/do` |
| Risky or multi-step changes | Approval boundaries and explicit verification |
| Several agents or branches | Isolated worktrees, ownership, and shared discoveries |
| Work interrupted between sessions | Durable state and a concrete resume action |

For a short one-off edit, your coding agent may already be enough. Citadel does
not replace `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, branch protection, or human review.

## What Citadel can prove

Citadel publishes positive and negative outcomes from the same evidence
contract. Its v1 experiment does not support a savings claim: one matched
baseline timeout drove the aggregate advantage, and excluding that pair
reversed the economic direction. A later capability-profile run preserved the
verified rate but used more measured GPU energy. A representative fixture
shakedown reached 6/12 verified cells with zero false passes, but missed its
frozen energy gate. The [research site](https://sethgammon.github.io/Citadel/research.html)
publishes the bounded results and limitations together.

### Source-only proof program

The full source checkout retains a broader, reproducible proof program. These
maintainer instruments and their detailed artifacts are not included in the
slim GitHub Release.

| Evidence | Result | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Outside-authored public holdout | 24 distinct repositories, sealed routes, and 32 official verdicts. The controller verified 3/16 tasks versus 2/16 for direct Claude at 1.26% lower comparison cost. | Direct Claude verified only 12.5%, so the baseline was invalid. This is a diagnostic, not proof of reliability or savings. |
| Bounded hybrid pilot | Both policies verified 12/12 synthetic tasks. A local Qwen 3B support route used 38.7% less comparison cost than always-Claude. | One model pair, one machine, and author-selected tasks. Actual subscription cash and production generalization remain unknown. |
| Offline evidence replay | In a full source checkout, `npm run grant:verify` checks signed artifacts, source bindings, receipt chains, reports, and public claims without calling a model. | This maintainer command is source-only. Artifact integrity does not prove that an agent produced good work. |
| Deterministic recovery and safety comparisons | Journaled recovery produced 0 duplicate effects versus 3 for naive restart across six injected boundaries. Safety gates achieved 100% malicious recall and 0% benign false positives across 12 matched decisions. | Local deterministic fixtures only. No process-kill, power-loss, real exploit, or cross-OS claim. |
| Leased deploy-steward state machine | Across three 15-PR batches per arm, independent loops produced 315 stale-head race attempts; the leased steward produced 0. | Fake provider only. This is not GitHub, Actions, branch protection, or real-deployment evidence. |
| Protected GitHub deploy-steward comparison | Across three valid matched public runs, both policies merged 45/45 PRs through strict Actions checks and recorded exactly one successful GitHub Deployment per merge SHA. Independent loops incurred 106 failed merge races, 315 stale updates, and 421 interventions; the steward incurred 0 of each. | Six disposable public repositories under one account, plus one disclosed invalid run. Deployments are GitHub API records, not production releases. No speed, cost, human-utility, or broad reliability claim. |
| Historical npm-pack profile | At source commit `9bebf1a`, the private source package measured 9,123,375 packed bytes and 1,888 files, 5.7385% and 66 files below its frozen baseline. | Native marketplaces consume an exact GitHub release tag; the release trio remains the manual and offline assurance path. This frozen source-only measurement is not a current release-size or public-package claim. |

The public claim is deliberately narrow: Citadel can make agent evaluations
inspectable, reproducible, and fail-honest. Comparative real-user utility
remains open.

## Trust boundary

- Citadel runs with the permissions of Claude Code or Codex. It is not a
  sandbox and does not replace code review or branch protection.
- Verification reports `passed`, `failed`, `blocked`, or `unknown`. Missing
  evidence is not promoted to success.
- Project state and telemetry stay local by default. Citadel does not commit,
  push, or transmit them automatically.
- The automated suite validates Citadel's contracts and fixtures. It does not
  guarantee the quality of agent-written code.

Read [Security](SECURITY.md) and [Privacy](PRIVACY.md) before enabling Citadel in
a sensitive repository.

## Documentation

The stable release intentionally ships a small public documentation surface:

| Goal | Document |
|---|---|
| Acquire, install, update, roll back, or remove Citadel | [Installation](INSTALL.md) |
| Verify release archives and provenance | [Releases](docs/RELEASES.md) |
| Understand exact commands, candidates, and preview limits | [Routing Preview](docs/ROUTING_PREVIEW.md) |
| Understand runtime, state, and orchestration boundaries | [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Use package commands and supported flags | [CLI reference](docs/CLI.md) |
| Review shipped changes | [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) |

The extracted release includes <!-- GENERATED: skill-count -->48<!-- /GENERATED --> skills and <!-- GENERATED: hook-script-count -->35<!-- /GENERATED --> hook scripts across <!-- GENERATED: hook-event-count -->29<!-- /GENERATED --> lifecycle events. They are an internal catalog, not a prerequisite checklist.

Citadel keeps operational state separate from application code:

```text
.planning/                 Campaigns, runs, evidence, handoffs, and telemetry
.citadel/scripts/          Project-local coordination and reporting utilities
.claude/agent-context/     Rules supplied to delegated agents
.claude/harness.json       Project configuration generated by setup
```

## Common questions

**Does Citadel work on Windows?**

Yes. Hooks and scripts run on Node.js, and the Codex installer includes Windows
readiness checks.

**Can I choose which model each agent uses?**

Yes. Codex agent models and reasoning effort are project configuration, not
hardcoded internals. Citadel ships current Sol, Terra, and Luna defaults and
supports per-family or per-agent overrides, including `max` and `ultra` where
the selected Codex model supports them. See
[Agent model configuration](docs/CLI.md#agent-model-configuration).

**How do I remove it?**

Use `/unharness` to create a receipt-owned leave plan, review the exact
footprint, and apply it with the plan token. Legacy installs are inventoried
first and cannot claim exact removal. See [Installation](INSTALL.md).

**Where should I report a problem?**

Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel/discussions) for
questions or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel/issues) for
reproducible defects.
