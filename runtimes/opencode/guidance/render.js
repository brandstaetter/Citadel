// opencode reads AGENTS.md, then CLAUDE.md (session/instruction.ts:61-68), with
// the first project-level match winning.
//
// This was originally a re-export of the Codex renderer, on the reasoning that
// both target AGENTS.md so one renderer would do. That was wrong twice over: the
// re-export was never invoked by the installer (dead code), and its output is
// Codex-specific in ways that actively mislead an opencode agent — it announces
// itself as "the Codex-facing projection", has a "## Codex Notes" section, and
// tells the reader to invoke skills as `$skill-name`. Phase 5 verified that
// opencode registers each skill as a `/` slash command instead.
//
// So this renders opencode's own guidance, and only states things verified against
// opencode 1.18.30.
