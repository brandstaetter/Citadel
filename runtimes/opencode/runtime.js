Citadel adds its own skills directory there, so all skills are read from the checkout with nothing copied, and each also becomes a slash command.' },

    hooks: { support: 'partial', notes: 'Plugin hooks cover pre-tool gating (throw blocks the call, before the tool permission prompt), post-tool, prompt, compaction, and config; Stop and permission events are observe-only and batch/failure events have no equivalent. Stop findings are deferred into the next turn rather than discarded, which is delivery, not enforcement. A project may opt into re-prompting, which starts that next turn itself instead of waiting for a human, under a per-session cap; the event still cannot refuse to end the turn.' },
