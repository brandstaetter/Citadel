// Capability notes reflect opencode's actual plugin surface as verified against
// the anomalyco/opencode sources. opencode has no command hooks: lifecycle
// interception is an in-process plugin whose hooks mutate a shared output object
// and throw to block, so Citadel gates on tool.execute.before rather than on the
// permission hook, which upstream declares but never triggers.
