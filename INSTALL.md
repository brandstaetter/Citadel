# Install Citadel

The canonical stable installation guide. Citadel installs through the native
plugin marketplace in Claude Code or OpenAI Codex. GitHub Releases remain the
version and high-assurance artifact boundary; source `main` is development-only,
and the public npm package named `citadel` is unrelated to this project.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** or **OpenAI Codex**: the runtime Citadel extends.
- **[Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/)**: a supported LTS release required for hooks and scripts.
- A git repository you want Citadel to manage.

Authentication depends on the runtime you use. Citadel layers on top of the runtime you already have configured. There is no build step and no `npm install`; Citadel runs directly on Node.js.

## Recommended: Native Plugin Marketplace

The commands below pin `v1.3.6`. If that tag is not present on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel/releases), stop rather
than substituting floating `main`.

### OpenAI Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add SethGammon/Citadel --ref v1.3.6
codex plugin add citadel@citadel-local
```

Start a new Codex task and review the installed hooks through `/hooks` when
Codex asks. That native trust decision is intentional; Citadel must not bypass
or duplicate it.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add SethGammon/Citadel@v1.3.6 --scope local
claude plugin install citadel@citadel-local --scope local
```

Use `/reload-plugins` if Claude Code is already open. Local scope makes the
plugin available only for you in this repository.

### Prefer to have your agent install it?

Open the target repository in Claude Code or Codex and paste this:

<!-- This prompt is copied verbatim from README.md. Keep the two copies identical. -->

```text
Citadel is an open-source operating layer for Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. It
adds one /do entry point, repository-local state that survives sessions,
guarded multi-step workflows, and reviewable evidence with explicit Needs You
and Resume boundaries.

Install Citadel v1.3.6 from https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel using this
runtime's native plugin marketplace, then enable it for this repository. Use
project-local defaults and preserve removal evidence for every change. Do not clone main or change shared
configuration, sandbox settings, permissions, or user-wide settings without
asking me.

Only interrupt me for a platform-required trust or reload action, or for a real
configuration conflict. Verify the result, then tell me the single next action.
```

The prompt supplies the product definition, official source, exact version,
scope, safety boundary, and completion condition. The agent should use the
platform installer rather than recreate a package manager from prose.

## Manual Install

Run the commands below from the project you want Citadel to manage. Do not run
them from the extracted Citadel directory unless Citadel itself is the target.

### Acquire and verify a stable release

From [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel/releases), choose
one explicit `vX.Y.Z` tag and download all three matching assets into the same
directory:

- `citadel-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`
- `citadel-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.manifest.json`
- `citadel-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.sha256`

Before extraction, compute the archive SHA-256 and require it to match both the
sidecar and `artifact.sha256` in the external manifest. For example, on
PowerShell:

```powershell
$citadelArchive = (Resolve-Path '.\citadel-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz').Path
$citadelActual = (Get-FileHash $citadelArchive -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLowerInvariant()
$citadelSidecar = ((Get-Content "${citadelArchive}.sha256").Trim() -split '\s+')[0].ToLowerInvariant()
$citadelManifest = (Get-Content "${citadelArchive}.manifest.json" -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json).artifact.sha256.ToLowerInvariant()
if ($citadelActual -ne $citadelSidecar -or $citadelActual -ne $citadelManifest) { throw 'Citadel release digest mismatch' }
```

After that check succeeds, Windows users can extract, verify, and enter the
supported governed lifecycle without translating Bash paths:

```powershell
tar -xzf "$citadelArchive"
$env:CITADEL_ROOT = (Resolve-Path '.\citadel-X.Y.Z').Path
node "$env:CITADEL_ROOT\scripts\release-verify.js" "$citadelArchive" --ref vX.Y.Z --version X.Y.Z

Set-Location 'C:\absolute\path\to\target-project'
node "$env:CITADEL_ROOT\scripts\adopt.js" plan "$env:CITADEL_ROOT" --target . --project-runtime codex --out ..\citadel-adoption.plan.json --json
node "$env:CITADEL_ROOT\scripts\adopt.js" apply ..\citadel-adoption.plan.json --confirm <plan-token> --json
node "$env:CITADEL_ROOT\scripts\adopt.js" doctor --target . --json
node "$env:CITADEL_ROOT\scripts\install.js" --runtime codex --install
```

Use `--project-runtime claude` plus the Claude installer flags shown below when
Claude Code is the intended runtime.

On Linux or macOS, verify the sidecar with `sha256sum -c` (or compare
`shasum -a 256` output on macOS), then independently compare the result with
the external manifest. A missing asset or mismatch is a blocked install.

Optionally verify GitHub's signed provenance before running release code:

```bash
gh attestation verify citadel-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz -R SethGammon/Citadel
gh attestation verify citadel-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.manifest.json -R SethGammon/Citadel
gh attestation verify citadel-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.sha256 -R SethGammon/Citadel
```

On Linux or macOS, extract the archive only after those checks. It contains one
`citadel-X.Y.Z/` root. Point `CITADEL_ROOT` at that directory, then run its
structural verifier:

```bash
tar -xzf citadel-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
CITADEL_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/citadel-X.Y.Z
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/release-verify.js" citadel-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz \
  --ref vX.Y.Z --version X.Y.Z
```

The verifier requires the archive, external manifest, sidecar, embedded
manifest, file list, and hashes to agree.

### Development source (not a stable install)

Contributors may use
`git clone --branch main https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel.git` for source
testing. Floating `main` has no immutable release boundary and must not be used
or described as a stable install. `npm install citadel`, `npx citadel`, and npm
registry tarballs are unsupported acquisition paths.

### Create the governed project adoption

From the target repository, create a saved no-write plan:

```bash
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" plan "$CITADEL_ROOT" \
  --target . \
  --project-runtime codex \
  --out ../citadel-adoption.plan.json \
  --json
```

Write the plan outside the target repository. Creating a plan inside the target
changes the target after its preflight snapshot and invalidates apply with
`TARGET_DRIFT`.

Use `--project-runtime claude` for Claude Code or
`--project-runtime both` when both projections are intentional. Review the
owned/shared footprint and every external registration whose removal evidence
is `unknown`. Then apply the exact saved plan:

```bash
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" apply ../citadel-adoption.plan.json \
  --confirm <plan-token> \
  --json

node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" doctor --target . --json
```

Planning writes only when `--out` is explicitly requested. Apply rechecks the
target, source, pre-images, and plan digest; a changed input is rejected.

The runtime-specific scripts below are the one-major bootstrap compatibility
adapters for marketplace/plugin registration. They are still useful where the
runtime has no project-scoped registration API, but their external effects
remain `unknown` until observed. Receipt-owned project files, update, rollback,
restore, and leave use `scripts/adopt.js`.

`scripts/install.js` is a dispatcher: `--runtime claude` runs
`scripts/claude-install.js` and `--runtime codex` runs
`scripts/codex-install.js`. The commands below use the dispatcher; the
runtime-specific scripts accept the same flags if you prefer to call them
directly.

### Claude Code compatibility installer

From your target project root:

```bash
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/install.js" --runtime claude --install --scope local
claude
```

The compatibility installer validates the marketplace, registers the extracted
release, and installs **Citadel Harness** in local scope. Native plugin hooks are
loaded by Claude Code; direct writes to `.claude/settings.json` require the
separate advanced `--install-hooks` flag.

Alternative manual install from inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/citadel-X.Y.Z
/plugin install citadel@citadel-local --scope local
```

For a one-session trial without registering the marketplace:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir "$CITADEL_ROOT"
```

To preview what the installer would write without changing anything:

```bash
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/install.js" --runtime claude --install --dry-run --json
```

The installer output names every Claude-specific external enable step and its
observed or unknown status.

### OpenAI Codex compatibility installer

From your target project root:

```bash
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/install.js" --runtime codex --install
codex
```

This command validates the package, registers the extracted release as a local
marketplace, and runs `codex plugin add citadel@citadel-local`. It does not
generate fallback project files or change Codex sandbox settings. Start a new
task and review Citadel through `/hooks`.

To preview what the installer would write without changing anything:

```bash
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/install.js" --runtime codex --dry-run --json
```

`scripts/install-hooks-codex.js` remains available for legacy per-project `.codex/hooks.json` installs, but plugin-bundled hooks are the preferred Codex path.

The installer output names every Codex-specific external enable step and its
observed or unknown status.

## First Run

Start a fresh Claude Code or Codex task in your project and give Citadel a real
request:

```text
/do review README.md
```

First-use state initializes automatically. Citadel reports `Needs You` only
when the platform requires trust/reload or when an existing or shared setting
would change. `/do setup` remains available later for optional profile, bundle,
integration, and guided-tour customization; it is not an installation gate.

### Setup modes

`/do setup` (without flags) opens with a mode selection:

- **Recommended**: detects the stack, previews Standard with Core +
  Persistence, applies only after the setup approval, reconciles the effective
  receipt, installs only bundle-owned hooks, and runs a bounded live demo.
- **Full Tour**: everything in Recommended, then offers separate plan/apply
  decisions for Parallel and Operations. Delivery remains off unless explicitly
  selected and supported.
- **Express**: zero questions after invocation. It applies the Standard Core +
  Persistence baseline, reconciles the effective receipt, installs the bounded
  hook projection, and exits.

Run `/do setup --express` to skip mode selection entirely.

### What setup does

In all modes, setup:

1. **Detects your stack and runtime capabilities** without writing project
   state.
2. **Builds the exact schema-v2 config plan** for Standard plus Core and
   Persistence. Recommended shows the plan; Express treats its explicit mode
   selection as approval of that bounded baseline.
3. **Applies and reconciles authority** into `.claude/harness.json` and
   `.citadel/effective-config.json`. Stale, malformed, or future receipts block
   non-Core execution.
4. **Installs only hooks owned by effective bundles**. A disabled skill or
   direct route is blocked with its activation plan instead of executing.
5. **Scaffolds project guidance without overwriting user content**.
6. **Runs a bounded live demo** in Recommended and Full Tour modes.

> **Why does the runtime-specific install still matter?**
> Claude Code and Codex use different native marketplace, activation, reload,
> and hook-trust flows. The native plugin remains the authority. Compatibility
> project projections are advanced migration tools, not the default install.

### Route your first task

```text
/do review src/main.ts              # 5-pass code review
/do generate tests for utils        # Tests that actually run
/do preview build a caching layer   # Exact/candidate preflight only; no execution
/do why is the login slow           # Root cause analysis
/do refactor the auth module        # Safe multi-file refactoring
```

Or describe what you want in plain English and let the `/do` router pick the tool:

```text
/do fix the login bug
/do what's wrong with the API
/do build a caching layer
```

Tier 0 is intentionally exact: `/do status` is deterministic only when the
whole request matches. `/do build`, `/do test`, and `/do typecheck` additionally
require the matching non-empty target `package.json` script. Larger requests
use generated built-in candidates as evidence for runtime semantic
classification. Preview does not inspect active state, discover custom project
skills, or run that classifier, so every natural-language preview is
non-executable. If you already know the route, override selection explicitly
without bypassing its activation or safety boundaries:

```text
/do --route /test-gen -- generate tests for utils
```

### Scale up when ready

```text
/marshal audit the codebase         # Multi-step, single session
/archon build the payment system    # Multi-session campaign
/fleet --quick overhaul all three services  # Parallel agents, shared discovery
/improve citadel --n=5              # Autonomous quality loops
```

Or let `/do` escalate automatically; it routes to orchestrators when the task requires it. Capture patterns you keep repeating with `/create-skill`.

## Verify

From the Citadel clone:

```bash
npm test
```

Success is a zero exit code; the suite covers hooks, skill structure, and installer checks.

To exercise the governed lifecycle exactly as a local user or adapter developer
would, including real scratch Git repositories, plan/apply/leave/restore, an
installed contracts tarball, NDJSON restart/replay, and proof suppression, run:

```bash
npm run test:governed-lifecycle
```

The resulting local proof is
`.planning/verification/governed-lifecycle.json`. It deliberately does not
stand in for an independently owned integration or a human cohort.

To verify the complete deterministic first-use seam for both runtime preparations:

```bash
node scripts/golden-path.js --runtime claude --fixture scripts/fixtures/golden-path/minimal-node.json
node scripts/golden-path.js --runtime codex --fixture scripts/fixtures/golden-path/minimal-node.json
```

These are isolated fixture runs, not proof of plugin registration or real-user
timing.

In your target project, success looks like this scaffold, created by the `init-project` hook on first session start:

```
your-project/
  .planning/              # Campaign state, fleet sessions, intake, telemetry
    _templates/           # Campaign and fleet templates (copied from plugin)
    campaigns/            # Active + completed campaigns
    fleet/                # Fleet session state + discovery briefs
    coordination/         # Multi-instance scope claims
    intake/               # Work items pending processing
    telemetry/            # Agent run + hook timing logs (JSONL, stays local)
  .citadel/
    scripts/              # Utility scripts synced from plugin each session
    plugin-root.txt       # Pointer to plugin install location
  .claude/
    harness.json          # Project config (generated by /do setup)
    agent-context/        # Rules injected into sub-agents
```

The harness logs agent events, hook timing, and discovery compression to `.planning/telemetry/` in JSONL format. Logs never leave your machine.

## Update, rollback, restore, and leave

All lifecycle mutations consume saved plans:

```bash
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" update plan "$CITADEL_NEXT_ROOT" \
  --migration migration.json --target . --out ../citadel-update.plan.json --json
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" update apply ../citadel-update.plan.json \
  --confirm <plan-token> --json

node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" rollback plan \
  --target . --out ../citadel-rollback.plan.json --json

node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" leave plan \
  --target . --out ../citadel-leave.plan.json --json
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/adopt.js" leave apply ../citadel-leave.plan.json \
  --confirm <plan-token> --json
```

Every saved lifecycle plan stays outside the target repository. This prevents
the plan file itself from changing the target after preflight and causing
`TARGET_DRIFT` during apply.

Update switches immutable generations only after verification. Rollback uses
the retained predecessor receipt and declared state migration compatibility.
Leave creates a versioned portable archive, restores exact shared-file
pre-images, deletes only unchanged owned material, and retains modified or
ambiguous entries. `citadel uninstall` is a compatibility alias for the same
leave plan/apply path. A legacy install without a receipt must first use
`adopt import plan`; the emergency `unharness --legacy-apply` path is explicitly
inexact and cannot support an exact-removal claim.

## Troubleshooting

**Hook not firing / "command not found" errors:**
Re-run the runtime-specific install step from your project root, then re-run `/do setup`:

```bash
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/install.js" --runtime claude --install --scope local
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/install.js" --runtime codex --install
```

Alternatively, run the hook installer directly from your project directory:

```bash
node "$CITADEL_ROOT/scripts/install-hooks.js"
```

**Moved the extracted Citadel directory:**
Resolved hook paths point at the old location. Refresh the runtime-specific
install step, then re-run `/do setup`.

**"[protect-files] Blocked" message:**
Citadel prevented an edit to a protected file. The message names the specific file and the pattern that triggered the block. To allow the edit, remove the pattern from `protectedFiles` in `.claude/harness.json`.

**"[Circuit Breaker] tool has failed N times" message:**
A tool failed repeatedly. This is Citadel suggesting you try a different approach, not an error in Citadel itself. The message names the specific tool and shows the last error. Read the suggestions and switch strategy.

**Campaign file in broken state:**
If a campaign file in `.planning/campaigns/` has corrupted YAML frontmatter or invalid status, delete the file and restart the campaign. Campaign logs in `.planning/improvement-logs/` and `.planning/telemetry/` are preserved independently.

**"/do setup" fails or produces empty harness.json:**
Ensure you are running from your project root (not the Citadel plugin directory). Setup needs to detect your project's language and framework from files like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, or `Cargo.toml`.

**Daemon won't start / "No active campaign" error:**
The daemon attaches to an active campaign. Check `.planning/campaigns/` for a file with `Status: active`. If none exists, start work first with `/improve`, `/archon`, or `/fleet --quick`, then attach the daemon.

**Daemon is paused (level-up-pending):**
An improve loop hit distribution saturation and needs human approval for the next quality level. Review the proposals at `.planning/rubrics/{target}-proposals.md`, edit the rubric with approved changes, and set the campaign status back to `active`. The daemon's watchdog will detect the change and resume automatically.

## Next Steps

- Add your project's conventions to `CLAUDE.md`; the more specific, the better.
- Add your project's conventions to `AGENTS.md` if you use Codex.
- Run `/do --list` to see all <!-- GENERATED: skill-count -->48<!-- /GENERATED --> installed skills.
- Drop a task in `.planning/intake/` and run `/autopilot` for hands-off execution.
- Read [Routing Preview](docs/ROUTING_PREVIEW.md) before treating static candidate evidence as a selected route.
- Read [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the Request → Run → Evidence → Needs You / Resume boundary.
- Use the [CLI reference](docs/CLI.md) and [Releases](docs/RELEASES.md) for supported commands and artifact verification.

Citadel pairs well with [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), which teaches methodology: brainstorm before coding, write tests first, review before shipping. Citadel supplies the infrastructure to execute that methodology at scale with campaign persistence, fleet coordination, lifecycle hooks, and telemetry. They are complementary.
